# Switch Card Game - Feature Enhancements

## Current Status

The Switch card game implementation includes a solid foundation with core mechanics working. This document tracks planned enhancements and improvements.

## Core Game Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented

- [x] Basic card system (Card, Deck, Hand classes)
- [x] Player management
- [x] Game manager and turn system
- [x] Switch-specific deck factory
- [x] Basic game rules framework
- [x] Trick card identification (2, 3, 5‚ô•, 7, 8, Jack, Ace)
- [x] Test framework and automated testing
- [x] Card dealing and initial setup
- [x] Basic card matching (suit/rank)
- [x] Universal card functionality (Aces, 7s)

### üöß Partially Implemented

- [ ] **Turn advancement logic** - Basic turn passing works, needs skip/direction handling
- [ ] **Penalty system** - Framework exists, needs timing and application fixes
- [ ] **7s mirror functionality** - Partially implemented, needs completion
- [ ] **Run mechanics** - Basic run detection, needs full sequence handling

### ‚ùå Not Implemented

- [ ] **Multiple card play** - Playing multiple cards of same rank
- [ ] **Draw card mechanics** - Players drawing when they can't play
- [ ] **Last card announcement** - "Switch!" announcement system
- [ ] **Game end conditions** - Proper win/lose detection
- [ ] **Score system** - Point calculation and tracking

## Priority Enhancements

### Priority 1: Core Gameplay Fixes üî¥

#### Turn Management System

**Issue**: Turn advancement doesn't handle Jacks (skips) or 8s (direction changes) properly

- [ ] Implement skip logic based on player count
- [ ] Handle direction reversal with 8s
- [ ] Support multiple consecutive turns (8+8 = same player)
- [ ] Fix turn order when penalties are applied

#### Penalty Application Timing

**Issue**: Penalties are applied immediately instead of when player can't counter

- [ ] Delay penalty application until next player's turn
- [ ] Allow players to counter active penalties
- [ ] Handle penalty accumulation (2+2+5‚ô• = 9 cards)
- [ ] Reset penalty state after application

#### Mirror Card (7s) Completion

**Issue**: 7s are partially implemented but don't fully mirror last card

- [ ] Implement proper rank/suit mirroring
- [ ] Handle mirroring during different game phases
- [ ] Ensure mirrored state persists for next player
- [ ] Test 7s in various scenarios

### Priority 2: Missing Core Mechanics üü†

#### Run System Completion

**Current**: Basic run detection exists
**Needed**:

- [ ] Full sequence validation (3‚Üí4‚Üí5...‚ÜíK‚ÜíA)
- [ ] Proper run termination at Ace
- [ ] King‚ÜíAce transition handling
- [ ] Run failure penalties (pick up cards = current rank)
- [ ] Invalid sequence penalties
- [ ] Run finish rule (can't win on trick card during run)

#### Draw Card Mechanics

**Current**: Not implemented
**Needed**:

- [ ] Player option to draw card instead of playing
- [ ] Automatic draw when no valid moves
- [ ] Deck reshuffling when empty
- [ ] Draw limits and rules

#### Multiple Card Play

**Current**: Not implemented
**Needed**:

- [ ] Allow playing multiple cards of same rank
- [ ] Proper suit selection for top card
- [ ] Integration with trick card effects
- [ ] UI/UX for selecting multiple cards

### Priority 3: Polish & UI Features üü°

#### Game End System

- [ ] Proper winner detection
- [ ] Score calculation based on remaining cards
- [ ] Multiple round support
- [ ] Game statistics tracking

#### Player Experience

- [ ] "Switch!" announcement system
- [ ] Card play animation timing
- [ ] Turn indication and feedback
- [ ] Help system with rules reference

#### Advanced Features

- [ ] AI player implementation
- [ ] Difficulty levels
- [ ] Custom deck creation
- [ ] Game variants (different rules)

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality üîß

#### Architecture Enhancements

- [ ] **Improved state management** - More robust game state tracking
- [ ] **Signal system optimization** - Better event handling
- [ ] **Error handling** - Comprehensive error recovery
- [ ] **Performance optimization** - Efficient card operations

#### Testing Improvements

- [ ] **Integration tests** - Full game scenario testing
- [ ] **Performance tests** - Large deck handling
- [ ] **Edge case testing** - Unusual game situations
- [ ] **Automated regression testing** - Prevent feature breaks

#### Documentation

- [ ] **API documentation** - Complete class/method docs
- [ ] **Tutorial system** - In-game rule explanations
- [ ] **Developer guide** - Extension and customization
- [ ] **Troubleshooting guide** - Common issues and fixes

### UI/UX Improvements üé®

#### Visual Polish

- [ ] **Card visuals** - Attractive card rendering
- [ ] **Animation system** - Smooth card movements
- [ ] **Visual feedback** - Hover effects, selection indication
- [ ] **Theme system** - Multiple visual themes

#### User Interface

- [ ] **Menu system** - Game options and settings
- [ ] **Settings screen** - Customizable game options
- [ ] **Statistics screen** - Game history and stats
- [ ] **Help/Rules screen** - Interactive rule reference

## Research & Exploration

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

1. **Fix core mechanics first** - Ensure solid foundation
2. **Test thoroughly** - Each feature should have comprehensive tests
3. **Incremental deployment** - Small, working improvements
4. **User feedback integration** - Test with actual players

### Risk Factors

- **Complexity creep** - Keep features focused on core gameplay
- **Performance impact** - Monitor frame rates with animations
- **Platform compatibility** - Test across different devices
- **Multiplayer complexity** - Start with local play first

### Success Metrics

- **Gameplay smoothness** - No crashes or broken states
- **Rule accuracy** - Matches official Switch rules
- **Player engagement** - Fun and intuitive to play
- **Code maintainability** - Easy to extend and modify
